-- Benedict Anderson, *Imagined Communities*, [36](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2016/SOC757/um/61816961/Benedict_Anderson_Imagined_Communities.pdf).

Prior to mass media, culture and identity were local, the products of face-to-face community and conversation. The 19th-century industrial press brought daily or even twice-a-day updates to French citizens. As wide distribution elevated individual opinions to group opinions, culture and identity became nationally cohesive. Public opinion -- "l'Opinion" -- rose into being, looming over the political class. The industrial press was its handler. Political scandal, colonial conquest, and national rivalry all passed through the printed word to determine, and shape, the people's will.

This app integrates with the French National Archives [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica) and [Gallicagram](https://shiny.ens-paris-saclay.fr/app/gallicagram) to allow rapid exploration of trends across thousands of periodicals. Clicking on the graph pulls a sample of occurrences from that period.


### Do I need to speak French to use it?

Most of the periodicals in the archive are in French, so French words are most relevant. There are, though, a sizeable number of international or 
European editions in English, such as the New York Herald. Play around with it!  

### What do I see on the results page?

Beneath the chart is a table of records pulled from Gallica, with links to the scanned periodical. Clicking on
a point in the chart will list the corresponding records. You can also make direct requests by entering
a date above the table. I'm still designing this section for better usability -- I think it's the most
interesting part of the tool. You can see cultural trends as they arise, then dive into the texts that 
provide context.
