# The Gallica Grapher

### Pull requests and new contributors welcome! 

If you have an idea, suggestion, or question about the code, don't hesitate to make a pull request or new issue. 

This app relies on the [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica) and [Pyllicagram](https://github.com/regicid/pyllicagram). You can find the Gallica JSON API I built in the [gallica-getter](https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-getter) repository.
