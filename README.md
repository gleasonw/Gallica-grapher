# The Gallica Grapher

> "... the search was on, so to speak, for a new way of linking fraternity, power and time meaningfully together. Nothing perhaps more precipitated this search, nor

-- Benedict Anderson, *Imagined Communities*, [36](https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2016/SOC757/um/61816961/Benedict_Anderson_Imagined_Communities.pdf).

The industrial press, developed throughout the early 19th century, brought daily or even twice-a-day updates to French citizens. Prior to mass media, culture and identity were local, the products of face-to-face community and conversation. Wide distribution elevated individual opinions to group opinions. Culture and identity became nationally cohesive; ‚Äúpublic opinion‚Äù rose into being, looming over the political class, and the press was its handler.

This app integrates with the French National Archives [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica) and [Gallicagram](https://shiny.ens-paris-saclay.fr/app/gallicagram) to allow rapid exploration of trends across thousands of periodicals. 


### Do I need to speak French to use it?

Most of the periodicals in the archive are in French, so French words are most relevant. There are, though, a sizeable number of international or 
European editions in English, such as the New York Herald. Play around with it!  


### How do I begin a search?  

1. Enter a term into the search bar;  


2. Select a grouping of periodicals to survey;
3. If you would like to add a search (another trend line on the graph), click "compare";
3. Click the 'Fetch and Graph üìä' button;
4. Watch the results roll in. If your term is especially popular, I would recommend a cup of tea. Requests run concurrently, but to avoid 
blasting the French national library's servers, I have erred on a smaller number of worker threads.

### What do I see on the results page?

Beneath the chart is a table of records pulled from Gallica, with links to the scanned periodical. Clicking on
a point in the chart will list the corresponding records. You can also make direct requests by entering
a date above the table. I'm still designing this section for better usability -- I think it's the most
interesting part of the tool. You can see cultural trends as they arise, then dive into the texts that 
provide context.

Many of these pretty boxes and backgrounds exist thanks to inspect source and the good taste of the Lichess.com CSS designer. Merci.
