                <section>
                    <p>This tool exists thanks to the wondrously open and interesting {GallicaApiLink},
                    a product of the French National archives. I used the API for undergraduate research on
                    19th century French culture. Now that I have
                        graduated, time is momentarily (I hope) plentiful, and I'm trying my hand at making a website out of it.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to speak French to use it?</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>Most of the periodicals in the archive are in French, so French words are most relevant. There are, though, a sizeable number of international or
                        European editions in English, such as the New York Herald. Play around with it!</p>

                    <p>Pour les francophones qui se demandent pourquoi ce site est en anglais : je vais traduire le site bientÃ´t, je me concentre sur le systÃ¨me pour l'instant.</p>

                <h3> How do I begin a search? </h3>
                <section>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Enter a term into the search bar;</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Select a grouping of periodicals to survey;</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>If you would like to add a search (another trend line on the graph), click "compare";</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Click the 'Fetch and Graph ðŸ“Š' button;</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Watch the results roll in. If your term is especially popular, I would recommend a cup of tea. Requests run concurrently, but to avoid
                            blasting the French national library's servers, I have erred on a smaller, more polite number of worker threads.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <h3>What do I see on the results page?</h3>
                <section>
                    <p>The Gallica API returns a record for any occurrence of a term in a periodical issue. I parse these records
                        and group occurrences within the same year, month, or on the same day to create a time series for each request.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>

                    Beneath the chart is a table of the records pulled from Gallica, with links to the scanned periodical. Clicking on
                    a point in the chart will list the corresponding records. You can also make direct requests by entering
                    a date above the table. I'm still designing this section for better usability -- I think it's the most
                    interesting part of the tool. You can see cultural trends as they arise, then dive into the texts that
                    provide context.

                    Much of these pretty boxes and backgrounds exist thanks to inspect source and the good taste of the Lichess.com CSS designer. Merci.
