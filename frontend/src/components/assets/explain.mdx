This app stands on the shoulders of giants. My thanks to:

1. The French National Archives [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica), for an easy-to-use, open, data-rich API;
2. [Gallicagram](https://shiny.ens-paris-saclay.fr/app/gallicagram), for their tremendous efforts in scanning the Gallica archive and building a vast trove of normalized word count data, accessible through a speedy API. This app would otherwise not be possible. For deeper lexical analysis, please try their app!
3. The [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) Javascript library, which has made building reactive interfaces a pleasure.

The Gallica Grapher aims to make exploring thousands of periodicals easy and enjoyable. Clicking on the graph pulls a sample of occurrences from that period.

If you have a suggestion or problem, you can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WillGleason9).

### Pull requests and new contributors welcome!

Please don't hesitate to make a pull request or new issue on [Github](https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher). I would love if this tool became a community project, maintained and designed by its audience. The core parsing code is written in Python, the frontend in Typescript and React. I am working to make the code more accessible and readable.

Don't be afraid to mess around with the code! The web ecosystem has progressed enormously over the last ten years or so. I knew nothing about reactive web design when I started this project in the summer of 2022.

### Analyzing the Press

The 19th-century industrial press brought daily or even twice-a-day updates to French citizens. As wide distribution elevated individual opinions to group opinions, culture and identity became more nationally cohesive. Public opinion -- l'Opinion -- rose into being, looming over the political class. The industrial press was its handler.
