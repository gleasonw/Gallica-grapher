# The Gallica Grapher

This app stands on the shoulders of giants, namely, the French National Archives [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica) (context), [Gallicagram](https://shiny.ens-paris-saclay.fr/app/gallicagram) (normalized word count data), and the [React documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org/) (interactivity). The Gallica Grapher aims to make exploring thousands of periodicals easy and enjoyable. Clicking on the graph pulls a sample of occurrences from that period.

### Pull requests and new contributors welcome!

If you have an idea, suggestion, or question about the code, don't hesitate to make a pull request or new issue on [Github](https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher). I would love if this tool became a community project, maintained and designed by its audience. The core parsing code is written in Python, the frontend in Typescript and React. I am working to make the code more accessible and readable.

 Don't be afraid to mess around with the code! The web ecosystem has progressed enormously over the last ten years or so. I knew nothing about making reactive web applications when I started this project in the summer of 2022.

If you would prefer to contact me instead, you can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WillGleason9). Rarely will you find a developer so available; this project is keeping me busy during the job search.

### Analyzing the Press

The 19th-century industrial press brought daily or even twice-a-day updates to French citizens. As wide distribution elevated individual opinions to group opinions, culture and identity became more nationally cohesive. Public opinion -- "l'Opinion" -- rose into being, looming over the political class. The industrial press was its handler. Political scandal, colonial conquest, and national rivalry all passed through the printed word to determine, and shape, the people's will.

### Do I need to speak French to use it?

Most of the periodicals in the archive are in French, so French words are most relevant. There are, though, a sizeable number of international or
European editions in English, such as the New York Herald. Play around with it!
