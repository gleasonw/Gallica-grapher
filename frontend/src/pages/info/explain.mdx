# The Gallica Grapher

This app integrates with the French National Archives [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica) and [Gallicagram](https://shiny.ens-paris-saclay.fr/app/gallicagram) to explore trends across thousands of periodicals. Clicking on the graph pulls a sample of occurrences from that period.

### Pull requests and new contributors welcome!

If you have an idea, suggestion, or question about the code, don't hesitate to make a pull request or new issue on [Github](https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher). The core parsing code is written in Python, the frontend in Typescript and React.

### Analyzing the Press

> "... a new way of linking fraternity, power and time meaningfully together ... [print-capitalism] made it possible for

> relate themselves to others, in profoundly new ways."

The 19th-century industrial press brought daily or even twice-a-day updates to French citizens. As wide distribution elevated individual opinions to group opinions, culture and identity became more nationally cohesive. Public opinion -- "l'Opinion" -- rose into being, looming over the political class. The industrial press was its handler. Political scandal, colonial conquest, and national rivalry all passed through the printed word to determine, and shape, the people's will.

### Do I need to speak French to use it?

Most of the periodicals in the archive are in French, so French words are most relevant. There are, though, a sizeable number of international or
European editions in English, such as the New York Herald. Play around with it!
