This app integrates with the French National Archives [Gallica API](https://api.bnf.fr/fr/api-document-de-gallica) and [Gallicagram](https://shiny.ens-paris-saclay.fr/app/gallicagram) to explore trends across thousands of periodicals. Clicking on the graph pulls a sample of occurrences from that period.

### Do I need to speak French to use it?

Most of the periodicals in the archive are in French, so French words are most relevant. There are, though, a sizeable number of international or
European editions in English, such as the New York Herald. Play around with it!
